Welcome to the repository for my latest project: a 6-channel radio control system designed for various model vehicles such as RC planes, cars, boats, and more. This project leverages EasyEDA for PCB design and uses Arduino Nano paired with 2.4GHz NRF24L01 modules for long-range wireless communication. The system employs the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol for rapid and reliable data transfer between the Arduino and NRF24L01 modules.
