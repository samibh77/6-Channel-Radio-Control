# 🎮 6-Channel Radio Control System

---

## 🔎 Overview
This project is a **custom 6-channel radio control (RC) system** designed for model vehicles such as **planes, cars, boats, and drones**.  

It uses an **Arduino Nano** paired with an **NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless module** to achieve reliable long-range communication.  
A custom **PCB designed in EasyEDA** integrates all the electronics, while the **SPI protocol** ensures fast and stable data transfer between the microcontroller and wireless modules.  

The goal of this project is to provide a **low-cost, open-source, and flexible RC solution** that hobbyists and makers can adapt to their own vehicles.
