🔎 Overview
This project is a **custom 6-channel radio control (RC) system** designed for model vehicles such as planes, cars, and boats.  
The system combines **Arduino Nano microcontrollers** with **NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless modules** to achieve reliable long-range communication.  

A custom **PCB was designed in EasyEDA** to integrate the electronics, while the **SPI protocol** ensures fast and stable data transfer between the microcontroller and wireless modules.  

The goal of this project is to provide a **low-cost, open-source, and flexible RC solution** that hobbyists and makers can adapt to their own vehicles.
