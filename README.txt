6-Channel Radio Control System

---

 🔎 Overview
This project is a custom 6-channel radio control (RC) system designed for model vehicles such as planes, cars, boats, and drones.  

It uses an Arduino Nano paired with an NRF24L01 2.4GHz wireless module to achieve reliable long-range communication.  
A custom PCB designed in EasyEDA integrates all the electronics, while the SPI protocol ensures fast and stable data transfer between the microcontroller and wireless modules.  

The goal of this project is to provide a low-cost, open-source, and flexible RC solution that hobbyists and makers can adapt to their own vehicles.
